# Portfolio
A small collection of some of the note-worthy projects I have worked on.

## XML to CSV Converter (Electron, AngularJS, NodeJS)
An electron app that allows the client to upload an large (100MB+) XML file, choose which data points to convert, and save the final converted file.

The app was built using the electron framework which uses AngularJS as the front-end and NodeJS as the back-end.  A few AngularJS & Node modules were used to help with uploading, conversion and async executions. Running an electron app allowed for high conversion times without server timeouts.

## RSVP Web App (AngularJS, Firebase)
A RSVP tool used for a birthday where each guest was given a unique code.  If you provided the correct code, the app would identify you and allow you to RSVP & select a drink of choice.

The responsive web app was built 100% on the front-end.  AngularJS as the front-end framework and firebase as the cloud database.  AngularFire was used to sync AngularJS data with Firebase DB.  An Admin Panel was also built for managing codes, RSVPs & drink choices.  HTML5 background video was used for desktop & static image for ipad/iphone (due to no autoplay support).
