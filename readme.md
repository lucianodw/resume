## XML to CSV Converter (Electron, AngularJS, NodeJS)
An electron app that allows the client to upload an large (100MB+) XML file, choose which data points to convert, and save the final converted file.

The app was built using the electron framework which uses AngularJS as the front-end and NodeJS as the back-end.  A few AngularJS & Node modules were used to help with uploading, conversion and async executions. Running an electron app allowed for high conversion times without server timeouts.

## RSVP Web App (AngularJS, Firebase)
A RSVP tool used for a birthday where each guest was given a unique code.  If you provided the correct code, the app would identify you and allow you to RSVP & select a drink of choice.

The responsive web app was built 100% on the front-end.  AngularJS as the front-end framework and firebase as the cloud database.  AngularFire was used to sync AngularJS data with Firebase DB.  An Admin Panel was also built for managing codes, RSVPs & drink choices.  HTML5 background video was used for desktop & static image for ipad/iphone (due to no autoplay support).

**To Demo Web App, use code _TEST_**

A bootstrap button generator used by Direct Wines to produce branded buttons.

The simple tool was used for the Design team to quickly add class names to buttons to get the look & feel they wanted.  The app was built using AngularJS as the front-end frame work - to take advantage of the two-way data-binding feature.
